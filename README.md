# Apache-Log-Analyzer-using-PySpark-for-Big-Data-Security
This project analyzes Apache web server logs using PySpark in Google Colab. It parses raw logs with regex to extract IPs, request types, URLs, and status codes. Using Sparkâ€™s distributed power, it identifies top IPs, most requested URLs, and HTTP errors for security monitoring and anomaly detection.
